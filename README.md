# FastestNumberGuess01

This program using multi-threading that will reduce the iterations and time taken to the lowest possible to guess the number, print the total number of iterations.

1.	The program should prompt the user to enter the number between the given range between 0 to maximum (999999999999999).
2.	Input will be taken from the keyboard.
3.	After the user enters the number, the computer will start the timer and start iterating from 0 to that number.
4.	Multiple threads (hundred/ thousand) will break and divide the above task to make it faster and in fewer iterations.
5.  It prints the total elapsed time took to find it.
